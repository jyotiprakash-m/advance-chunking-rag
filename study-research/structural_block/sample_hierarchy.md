# Machine Learning Guide

## Introduction
Machine learning is transforming how we solve complex problems.

### What is ML?
ML enables computers to learn patterns from data without explicit programming.

### Why It Matters
ML applications span from recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles.

## Core Concepts

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled training data.

#### Classification
Classification predicts categorical outcomes.

#### Regression
Regression predicts continuous values.

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data.

#### Clustering
Clustering groups similar data points.

#### Dimensionality Reduction
Reduces feature space while preserving information.

## Advanced Topics

### Deep Learning
Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers.

### Natural Language Processing
NLP enables computers to understand and generate human language.

## Conclusion
Machine learning continues to evolve and impact various industries.
